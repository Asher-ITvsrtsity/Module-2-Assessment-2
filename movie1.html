                    <li>Daring outlaw Puss discovers that his passion for peril and his disregard for safety have taken their toll. Heʼs burned through 8 of his 9 lives, but he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send him on his grandest quest, yet.

                        He embarks on a journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But, with only one life left, heʼll have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis, the captivating Kitty Soft Paws.
                        
                        In their quest, Pussy and Kitty will be aided—against their better judgement— by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro. Together, theyʼll have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks and the Three Bears Crime Family, “Big” Jack Horner and terrifying bounter The Big Bad Wolf.</li>
